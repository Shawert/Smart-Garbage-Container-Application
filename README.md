# Smart-Garbage-Container-Application
Assembly-MicroC-Pic16F877-LM016L-MQ-4

Objective: The aim of this project is to monitor the fill level and gas levels of garbage containers using gas and weight sensors. When predefined thresholds are exceeded, the system provides alerts and performs specified operations.

Circuit: The microcontroller reads data from the methane gas sensor and monitors the fill level of the container using the weight sensor. When the predefined thresholds are surpassed, the system activates a red LED and a buzzer, and the LCD screen displays which sensor has been triggered.

Components: Pic16F877 microcontroller, Buzzer, LEDs (green and red), LM016L LCD Screen, MQ-4 Gas Sensor (Data simulated with a Potentiometer), resistors.
